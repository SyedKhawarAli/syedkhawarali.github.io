Designed and developed a browser-based system that allows instructors to create, conduct, and evaluate quizzes, thereby streamlining the academic process. As the project's front-end developer, I used HTML, JavaScript and jQuery to build its entire interface. I also worked on the back-end communication, using WAMP to manage the website's database.

## Clinic Management System

Created a website to store patients histories, medical tests, and past diagnoses for use by doctors. Patients could also use the system to track their own cases and check doctors' timings and book appointments. I was the project's front-end developer and used 'dreamweare' to build it.
