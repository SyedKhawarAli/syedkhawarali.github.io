I'm an application developer at [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](http://www.uet.edu.pk/)'s [Game Studio](http://www.kics.edu.pk/labs/about/uetgs). I'm currently working on designing and developing edutainment games using the [Corona SDK](https://coronalabs.com/).

Prior to this, I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from the [University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore](http://www.uet.edu.pk/), in 2016, where I was on the varsity football team.

My interests are in application development, mobile development and cloud computing.

# Personal Projects

## [Pong Fun](https://github.com/SyedKhawarAli/Pong-Fun)
A simple arcade game inspired by minimalist design and elementary physics. Your mission in the game is to use the paddle to keep the balls on the screen. With time, more balls are added to the mix to put you through your paces. The game was built to test players' [divided attention](https://edubloxtutor.com/improving-divided-attention/) to see how well they can multitask.

## Online Quiz System

Designed and developed a browser-based system that allows instructors to create, conduct, and evaluate quizzes, thereby streamlining the academic process. As the project's front-end developer, I used HTML, JavaScript and jQuery to build its entire interface. I also worked on the back-end communication, using WAMP to manage the website's database.

## Clinic Management System

Created a website to store patients histories, medical tests, and past diagnoses for use by doctors. Patients could also use the system to track their own cases and check doctors' timings and book appointments. I was the project's front-end developer and used 'dreamweare' to build it.
